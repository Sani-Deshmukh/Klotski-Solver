# üß© Klotski Puzzle Solver  
*A Search-Based Solver for the Classic Sliding-Block Puzzle Game*

## üìå Overview
Klotski is a well-known sliding-block puzzle game where players move blocks within a confined space to achieve a goal state. Some variations of Klotski are notoriously difficult, requiring dozens of moves to solve.

This project implements an **automatic Klotski solver** using **search algorithms** (BFS and DFS) in **OCaml**. The solver efficiently finds the shortest solution to a given Klotski board configuration and provides an **interactive mode** for manual solving.

## üöÄ Features
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS)** for automated solving  
- **Optimized state-space exploration** using functional programming concepts  
- **Interactive Mode** for manually solving puzzles via command-line  
- **Pre-loaded Test Cases** with multiple challenging Klotski boards  
- **Modular Design** implemented using OCaml functors for extensibility
